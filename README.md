## A Simple BFS Maze Algorithm

## Summary

This project was done using option 2 wherein the project is already existing and I only added a few simple tweaks as a new feature. The project is a simple searching algorithm using a BFS Algorithm to find the path from the starting state to the goal state.

## Modification:

I added a drop-down menu that will be used to choose from 3 different categories:

**Start** - is used to add a starting state which will be marked with the color yellow when a button is pressed.

**Goal** - is used to add your goal state which will be marked with the color red when a button is pressed.

**Obstacle** - allows user to add obstacles to the maze to prevent the algorithm from traversing that space.
